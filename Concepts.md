# Concepts

* Convolution
  * [Explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/computer-vision-convolution-basics-2d0ae3b79346)
  * Application:
    1. Open an image on [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
    2. Go to *Filters->Generic->Convolution Matrix*
    3. Click on preview
    4. Change the values from the 5x5 matrix reprented in the range-boxes. Example: <br> [0 0 0 0 0] <br>[0 -1 0 1 0] <br>[0 -1 0 1 0] <br>[0 -1 0 1 0] <br>[0 0 0 0 0]
