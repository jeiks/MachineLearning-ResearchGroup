# Machine Learning Research Group

Our focus is to study and address Machine Learning techniques to solve various problems in society.
It includes interdisciplinary fields outside of computing, such as biology, physics, and others.

At this moment, we are creating a solid background in Deep Learning and understanding the state-of-the-art (SOA) methods and techniques.
Therefore, this page will address news and main concepts of Machine Learning extracted from seminal and important articles in this area.
